\arguments{
\item{outcome_metric}{\code{String} with the metric of the health outcome to be assessed. Options: "deaths", "yll" or "yld".}

\item{pop_impact}{\code{Data frame} with projected population impact over time}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} of the year of analysis, which corresponds to the first year of the life table,}

\item{input_with_risk_and_pop_fraction}{\code{Data frame} with meta-information such as input data, additional information and intermediate results.}

\item{corrected_discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value}  with the annual discount rate as proportion (i.e. 0.1 instead of 10\%). It can be calculated as (1+discount_rate_beforeCorrection/1+rate_of_increase)-1}

\item{dw_central, dw_lower, dw_upper}{Three \code{Numeric value} showing the disability weights (central estimate, lower and upper 95% confidence intervals) associated with the morbidity health outcome}

\item{duration}{\code{Numeric value} showing the duration (in years) of the morbidity health outcome}

\item{age_min}{\code{Numeric value}  with the minimal age to be considered for adults (by default 30, i.e. 30+),}

\item{age_max}{\code{Numeric value}  with the maximal age to be considered for infants/children (by default 0, i.e. below 1 years old)}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} starting age of the youngest age group from population and life table data}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} ending age of the oldest age group from population and life table data}
