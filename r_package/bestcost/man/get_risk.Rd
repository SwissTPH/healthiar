\title{Re-scale the relative risk}
\usage{
get_risk(
  rr = NULL,
  exp,
  cutoff = NULL,
  erf_increment = NULL,
  erf_shape = NULL,
  erf_eq = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the relative risk. The data frame must contain the central estimate as well as the lower and upper bound of the exposure-response function.}

\item{exp}{Population exposure to the stressor (e.g. annual population-weighted mean).}

\item{cutoff}{\code{Numeric value} showing the cut-off exposure level in ug/m3 (i.e. the exposure level below which no health effects occur).}

\item{erf_increment}{\code{Numeric value} showing the size of the increment in concentration related to the relative risk provided in the literature (e.g. for 10 ug/m3 PM2.5).}

\item{erf_eq}{\code Equation of the user-defined exposure-response function that puts the relative risk (y) in relation with exposure (x). If the function is provided as \code{string}, it can only contains one variable: x (exposure). E.g. "3+x+x^2". If the function is provided as a \code{function}, the object should have a function class. If only the values of the x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) of the dots in the exposure-response function are available, a cubic spline natural interpolation can be assumed to get the function using, e.g., \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}}
}
\value{
This function returns three \code{values} corresponding to the central estimate as well as the lower and upper bound of the exposure-response function.
}
\description{
Re-scale the relative risk from the increment value in the epidemiological study (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the actual population exposure)
