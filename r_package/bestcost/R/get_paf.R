# Title and description

#' Get population attributable fraction
#'
#' Calculates the population attributable fraction of a health outcome due to exposure to an environmental stressor
#' @param rr_conc \code{Numerical value} Risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.
#' @param prop_pop_exp \code{Numerical value} Fraction ([0,1]) of population exposed to the environmental stressor. Per default = 1 (i.e. 100\% of population is exposed).
#' @return
#' This function returns a \code{value} corresponding to the population attributable fraction
#' @examples
