#' Health impacts based on life tables

#' @description
#' Calculates the years lived with disability attributable to the exposure to an environmental stressor using a life table approach. It provides the central estimate of the impact and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (based on the 95\% confidence interval exposure-response function).
