#' Compare attributable deaths obtained applying a life table approach

#' @description Calculates the deaths between two scenarios (e.g. before and
#' after a intervention in a health impact assessments). It provides as a result
#' the central estimate as well as the lower and the higher bound of the
#' confidence interval based on the uncertainty of the exposure-response
#' function.
#' @inheritParams compare
#'
#' @returns
#' TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
#' concentration-response function (i.e. central estimate, lower and upper bound confidence interval).
#' Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Attributable fraction
#'  \item Health impact
#'  \item Outcome metric
#'  \item And many more.
#' }
#' @examples
#' TBD
