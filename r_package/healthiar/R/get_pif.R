#' Get population impact fraction

#' @description
#' This function calculates the population impact fraction of a health outcome due to exposure to an environmental stressor

#' @param rr_at_exp_1 \code{Numerical value} showing the risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration in the scenario 1. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.
#' @param rr_at_exp_2 \code{Numerical value} showing the risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration in the scenario 2. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.
#' @param prop_pop_exp_1 \code{Numerical value} showing the fraction ([0,1]) of population exposed to the environmental stressor in the scenario 1. Per default = 1 (i.e. 100\% of population is exposed).
#' @param prop_pop_exp_2 \code{Numerical value} showing the fraction ([0,1]) of population exposed to the environmental stressor in the scenario 1. Per default = 1 (i.e. 100\% of population is exposed).

#' @returns
