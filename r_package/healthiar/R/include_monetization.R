#' @param approach_discount \code{String} referring to the method to be used for the discounting choosing between the default "direct" (after obtaining the health impacts) and the alternative "indirect" (before the health impacts).
#' @param output \code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.
#' @param impact \code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function).

#' @param corrected_discount_rate \code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years including correction from inflation rate
#' @param discount_shape \code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".
