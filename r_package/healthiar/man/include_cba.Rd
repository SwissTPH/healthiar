\arguments{
\item{approach_discount}{\code{String} referring to the method to be used for the discounting choosing between the default "direct" (after obtaining the health impacts) and the alternative "indirect" (before the health impacts).}

\item{output_healthiar}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact}

\item{cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the investment cost to achive the reduction of exposure}

\item{discount_rate_benefit, discount_rate_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the the discount rate used in the benefit and the cost side (respectively). Their values determine the approach of cost-benefit analysis: direct approach (if the same discount_rate is used for cost and benefit) and indirect approach (different discount rates)}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{discount_overtime}{\code{String} that refers to the year or years where the discounting has to be applied. Options: "all-years" (i.e. all years of the period of discounting; default option) or "last_year" (only last year of discounting). Only applicable if approach_discount = "direct".}

\item{benefit}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the positive health impact as result of a reduction of harmful exposure}
}
\value{
Description of the return value.
}
\description{
Perform cost-benefit analysis assuming that the monitized health impact is a benefit
