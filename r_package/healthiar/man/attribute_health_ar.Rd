\arguments{
\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric values} of the exposure to the environmental stressor referring to the central estimate and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or {vector} showing the population exposed for each of the exposure categories. The length of this input variable must be the same as "exp".}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} referring to the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function. If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable: x (exposure). E.g. "3+x+x^2". If a \code{function} is entered, it has to have a function class. If only the values of the x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) of the dots in the exposure-response function are available, a cubic spline natural interpolation can be assumed to get the function using, e.g., \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}}

\item{geo_id_raw}{\code{Vector} showing the id code of the each geographic area considered in the assessment. If a vector is entered here, the data for each geographical area have to be provided as list in the corresponding arguments.}

\item{geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Vector} showing the id code of the geographic area for which raw geo ids have to be aggregated. The vector has to have the same length as geo_id_raw. Therefore, geo_id_aggregated should have duplicated values for those geo_id_r}

\item{info}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{list} with two \code{data.frames}, one with the total health impact and the second one with a row for each category of the exposure distribution.
The data frame include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item TBD

(e.g. noise) using the absolute risk instead of the relative risk
