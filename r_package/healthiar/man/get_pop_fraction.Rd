\usage{
get_pop_fraction(rr_conc_1, rr_conc_2, prop_pop_exp_1, prop_pop_exp_2)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_conc_1}{\code{Numerical value} showing the risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration in the scenario 1. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.}

\item{rr_conc_2}{\code{Numerical value} showing the risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration in the scenario 2. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.}

\item{prop_pop_exp_1}{\code{Numerical value} showing the fraction ([0,1]) of population exposed to the environmental stressor in the scenario 1. Per default = 1 (i.e. 100\% of population is exposed).}

\item{prop_pop_exp_2}{\code{Numerical value} showing the fraction ([0,1]) of population exposed to the environmental stressor in the scenario 1. Per default = 1 (i.e. 100\% of population is exposed).}
