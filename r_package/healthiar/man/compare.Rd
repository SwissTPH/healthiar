\title{Compare the attributable health impacts between two scenarios}
\usage{
compare(output_attribute_1, output_attribute_2, approach_comparison = "delta")
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute_1}{Scenario 1 as in the output of attribute()}

\item{output_attribute_2}{Scenario 2 as in the output of attribute()}

\item{approach_comparison}{\code{String} showing the method of comparison. Options: "delta" or "pif".}
}
\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only applicable in relative risk assessments
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }
}
\description{
This function calculates the health impacts between two scenarios (e.g. before and after a intervention in a health impact assessments) using either the delta or pif approach.
}
\details{
Note that the PIF comparison approach assumes same baseline health data for scenario 1 and 2 (e.g. comparison of two scenarios at the same time).

Equations population impact fraction (PIF)

The Population Impact Fraction (PIF) is defined as the proportional change in disease or mortality when exposure to a risk factor is changed (for instance due to an intervention). The most general equation describing this mathematically is an integral form:
\deqn{PIF = \frac{\int RR(x)PE(x)dx - \int RR(x)PE'(x)dx}{\int RR(x)PE(x)dx}}

Where:

x     = exposure level

PE(x) = population distribution of exposure

PE'(x) = alternative population distribution of exposure

RR(x) = relative risk at exposure level compared to the reference level

If the population exposure is described as a categorical rather than continuous exposure, the integrals in equation (5) may be converted to sums, resulting in the following equations for the PIF:
\deqn{PIF = \frac{\sum RR_{i} \times PE_{i} - \sum RR_{i}PE'_{i}}{\sum RR_{i}PE_{i}}}

Where:

i     = is the exposure category (e.g. in bins of 1 \eqn{Âµg/m^3} PM2.5 or 5 dB noise exposure)

\eqn{PE_i} = fraction of population in exposure category i

\eqn{PE'_i} = fraction of population in category i for alternative (ideal) exposure scenario

\eqn{RR_i} = relative risk for exposure category level i compared to the reference level

Finally, if the exposure is provided as the population weighted mean concentration (PWC), the equation for the PIF is reduced to:
\deqn{PIF = \frac{RR_{PWC} - RR_{alt PWC}}{RR_{PWC}}}

Where:

\eqn{RR_{PWC}} = relative risk associated with the population weighted mean exposure

\eqn{RR_{PWC}} = relative risk associated with the population weighted mean for the alternative exposure scenario

Delta comparison approach

With the delta comparison the difference between two scenarios is obtained by substraction. The delta approach is suited for all comparison cases, and specifically for comparison of a situation now with a situation in the future.
