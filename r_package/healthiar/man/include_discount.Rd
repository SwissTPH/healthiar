\title{Attribute discounted health impact}
\usage{
include_discount(
  approach_discount = "direct",
  output_healthiar = NULL,
  impact = NULL,
  discount_rate = NULL,
  discount_years = 1,
  discount_shape = NULL,
  discount_overtime = "all_years",
  inflation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{approach_discount}{\code{String} referring to the method to be used for the discounting choosing between the default "direct" (after obtaining the health impacts) and the alternative "indirect" (before the health impacts).}

\item{output_healthiar}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function). If a \code{Numberic vector} is entered multiple assessments (by year) will be carried out. Be aware that the value for year 0 (current) must be entered, while discount_years does not include the year 0. Thus, length of impact = discount_years + 1.}

\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years. If it is a nominal discount rate, no inflation is to be entered. If it is a real discount rate, the result can be adjusted by entering inflation in this function.}

\item{discount_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the period of time to be considered in the discounting.}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{discount_overtime}{\code{String} that refers to the year or years where the discounting has to be applied. Options: "all-years" (i.e. all years of the period of discounting; default option) or "last_year" (only last year of discounting). Only applicable if approach_discount = "direct".}

\item{inflation}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Ony to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assumming no nominal discount rate)}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function i.e. central, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
It calculates discounted health impacts (without valuation).
