\title{Attribute discounted health impact}
\usage{
include_discount(
  approach_discount = "direct",
  output = NULL,
  impact = NULL,
  corrected_discount_rate = NULL,
  time_period = 1,
  discount_shape = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{approach_discount}{\code{String} referring to the method to be used for the discounting choosing between the default "direct" (after obtaining the health impacts) and the alternative "indirect" (before the health impacts).}

\item{output}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function).}

\item{corrected_discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years including correction from inflation rate}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function i.e. central, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
It calculates discounted health impacts (without valuation).
