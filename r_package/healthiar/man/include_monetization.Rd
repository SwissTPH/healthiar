\arguments{
\item{approach_discount}{\code{String} referring to the method to be used for the discounting choosing between the default "direct" (after obtaining the health impacts) and the alternative "indirect" (before the health impacts).}

\item{output}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function).}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numeric value} showing the value of statistical life which will be used in the health impact monetization}

\item{corrected_discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years including correction from inflation rate}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{discount_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the period of time to be considered in the discounting.}

\item{discount_overtime}{\code{String} that refers to the year(s) where the discounting has to be applied. Options: "all-years" (default) or "last_year". Only applicable if approach_discount = "direct".}
