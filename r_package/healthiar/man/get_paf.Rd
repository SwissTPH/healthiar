\title{Get population attributable fraction}
\usage{
get_paf(rr_conc, prop_pop_exp)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_conc}{\code{Numerical value} Risk estimate of the concentration response function for a specific concentration. The population attributable fraction is normally calculated using the risk estimate that refers to the concentration that reflects the population exposure and the cut-off. This risk estimate is obtained after re-scaling from the epidemiological study with a particular increment (e.g. for PM2.5 10 or 5 ug/m3) to the aimed concentration.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or {Numeric vector} Fraction (values between 0 & 1) of the total population exposed to (one or more) exposure categories, i.e., a exposure distribution, respectively. If a exposure distribution is used, the dimension of this input variable should be the same as "exp". By default, 1 for single exposure value will be assigned to this input variable assuming a single exposure value, but users can change this value.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{value} corresponding to the population attributable fraction
}
\description{
Calculates the population attributable fraction of a health outcome due to exposure to an environmental stressor
}
\note{
Experimental function

get_paf(rr = 1.062, prop_pop_exposed = 1)
