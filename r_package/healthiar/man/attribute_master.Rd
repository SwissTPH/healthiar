\arguments{
\item{approach_risk}{\code{String} specifying the risk risk method. Options: "relative_risk" (default) or "absolute_risk".}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the central estimate of the relative risk and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the concentration increment for which the provided relative risk is valid. Often 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions.
If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable: x (exposure), e.g. "3+x+x^2".
If a \code{function} is fed to the argument, it has be of the class function class, e.g. output from the functions \code{stats::splinefun()} or \code{stats::approxfun()}.
If you have x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) value pairs of multiple points lying on the the exposure-response function, you could use a cubic spline natural interpolation to derive the exposure-response function using, e.g. \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to each exposure categories.
If exposure categories are used, the dimension of this input must be the same as in the \code{exp_...} argument(s). Default: 1 for a single exposure value.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in \eqn{µg/m^3}. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{cutoff_central, cutoff_lower, cutoff_upper}{\code{Numeric value} showing the central exposure cut-off in \eqn{µg/m^3} and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.
The cutoff level refers to the exposure level below which no health effects occur.}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the basline (incidence) level of the health outcome in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.
If a vector is entered here, the data for geo-specific input data (e.g. \code{bhd_...}), \code{exp_...}) has to be provided as a list.}

\item{geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} an ID for each geographic area that specifies which geographic areas should be aggregated together.
E.g. if you provide the municipality names to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}, you might provide here the corresponding region / canton / province.
Consequently The vector has to have the same length as the one fed to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}.}

\item{approach_multiexposure}{\code{String} specifying the approach that has to be used in assessments with multiple exposures. To choose among: "additive", "multiplicative" or "combined". Default: \code{NULL} (i.e. no other exposure is considered besides the one specified in the \code{exp.._ argument(s)})}

\item{population_midyear_male, population_midyear_female}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year population for the year of analysis for female and male, respectively.}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the minimum age for which the exposure will affect the exposed population. By default 30, which implies that all adults aged 30 or older will be affected by the exposure.}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the maximum age until which age the population will be affected by the environmental exposure.}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} providing the year of analysis.}

\item{dw_central, dw_lower, dw_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the disability weight associated with the morbidity health outcome and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{duration_central, duration_lower, duration_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the disease duration in years and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper bounds of the 95\% confidence interval (default of \code{duratoin_central} is 1 year, which is aligned with the prevalence-based approach , while a value above 1 year corresponds to the incidence-based approach (Kim, 2022, https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.21.597).}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} specifying whether exposure is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant".}

\item{approach_newborns}{\code{String} specifying whether newborns are to be considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns". If "with_newborns" is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies are born, with n being equal to the (male and female) population aged 0 that is provided in the arguments \code{population_midyear_male} and \code{population_midyear_female}.}

\item{time_horizon}{\code{Numeric value} corresponding to time horizon (number of years) for which the impacts of exposure are to be considered.
For example, would be 10 if one is interested in the impacts of exposure during the year of analysis and the next 9 years.}

\item{population}{\code{Vector} providing the population (in each geographical unit).}

\item{health_outcome}{\code{String} specifying the (input and) outcome metric to assess attributable health impacts. To choose between "same_input_output" (default), "yld", "deaths_from_lifetable", "yll_from_lifetable", "yld_from_lifetable" and "daly_from_lifetable".}

\item{info}{\code{String} or {data.frame} providing additional information linked with the assessment.
The suffix "info" will be added to the column name.
Default value = \code{NULL}.}

\value{
This function returns two lists:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a tibble with the main results and
2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The result tibbles include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }
}
\description{
Calculates the health impacts, mortality or morbidity, of an environmental stressor using a single value for baseline heath data, i.e. without life table.
}
\details{
It provides as a result the mean as well as the lower and the higher bound of the impact based on the confidence interval of the concentration-response function.
