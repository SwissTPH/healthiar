\arguments{
\item{is_lifetable}{\code{Boolean} INTERNAL argument specifying if the life table approach is applied (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the concentration increment for which the provided relative risk is valid. Often 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}) (no default). Argument is applicable only in RR pathway.}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String value} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options (no default): \code{"linear"}, \code{log_linear}", \code{"linear_log"}, \code{"log_log"}. Argument is applicable only in RR pathway.}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions. See Details for more info.}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the population exposed for each exposure category. For absolute risk, the value of this argument must be entered, for relative risk it is optional.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to the exposure (categories). Default: 1. See Details for more info.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. See Details for more info.}

\item{cutoff_central, cutoff_lower, cutoff_upper}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the exposure cut-off in \eqn{µg/m^3} and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds. Default: 0. Only applicable in relative risk pathway. See Details for more info.}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} providing the baseline health data of the health outcome of interest in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds. Argument is only applicable in RR pathway. See Details for more info.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated, geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} or \code{string vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area considered in the assessment (\code{geo_id_disaggregated}) and (optionally) providing a higher-level ID at which the geographic areas will be aggregated (\code{geo_id_disaggregated}). Argument must be entered for iterations. See Details for more info.}

\item{health_outcome}{\code{String} specifying the desired result of the life table assessment. Options: \code{"deaths"} (premature deaths), \code{"yll"} (years of life lost).}

\item{population_midyear_female, population_midyear_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year populations per age (age interval = 1 year) for the year of analysis for females and males, respectively. See Details for more info.}

\item{deaths_female, deaths_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the deaths for the year of analysis per age (age interval = 1 year) for females and males, respectively.}

Default: 1. Optional argument. See Details for more info.}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} specifying whether exposure is constant or only in one year. Options: \code{"single_year"} (default), \code{"constant"}.}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the total population, including both exposed and non-exposed. See Details for more info.}

\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }

\description{
This INTERNAL function calculates the health impacts, mortality or morbidity, of an environmental stressor using a single value for baseline heath data, i.e. without life table.
