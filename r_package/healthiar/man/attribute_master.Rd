\arguments{
\item{is_lifetable}{\code{Boolean} INTERNAL argument specifying if the life table approach is applied (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{approach_risk}{\code{String} specifying the risk method. Options: \code{"relative_risk"} (default) or \code{"absolute_risk"}.}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the central estimate of the relative risk and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the concentration increment for which the provided relative risk is valid. Often 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}) (no default).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options: \code{"linear"}, \code{log_linear}", \code{"linear_log"}, \code{"log_log"}.}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions.
If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable c (concentration/exposure), e.g. \code{"3+c+c^2"}.
If a \code{function} is fed to the argument, it must be of the class \code{function}, e.g. output from \code{stats::splinefun()} or \code{stats::approxfun()} (see details).}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the population exposed for each exposure category. For absolute risk, the value of this argument must be entered, for relative risk only optional.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to each exposure categories. Only to be used for exposure distribution (if pop_exp not available) or if not the whole population is exposed. Otherwise, 1 will be assumed as default.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in \eqn{µg/m^3}. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{cutoff_central, cutoff_lower, cutoff_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} showing the central exposure cut-off in \eqn{µg/m^3} and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds. Default: 0. Only applicable to relative risk pathways.
If exposure categories are used, the dimension of this input must be the same as in the \code{exp_...} argument(s).
The cutoff level refers to the exposure level below which no health effects occur.}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the baseline health data of the health outcome of interest in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds. See Details section for more info.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric or string vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.}

\item{geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric or string vector} providing a higher-level ID at which the geographic areas specified in \code{geo_id_disaggregated} will be aggregated. See Details section for more info.}

\item{health_outcome}{\code{String} specifying if the result of the assessment with life table is premature deaths ("deaths") or years of life lost ("yll")}

\item{population_midyear_female, population_midyear_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year populations per age (age interval = 1 year) for the year of analysis for females and males, respectively. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{deaths_female, deaths_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the deaths for the year of analysis per age (age interval = 1 year) for females and males, respectively. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the minimum age for which the exposure will affect the exposed population. Default: 30. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the maximum age until which age the population will be affected by the environmental exposure. No default. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} providing the year of analysis.}

\item{approach_newborns}{\code{String} specifying whether newborns are to be considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns". If "with_newborns" is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies are born, with n being equal to the (male and female) population aged 0 that is provided in the arguments \code{population_midyear_male} and \code{population_midyear_female}.}

\item{time_horizon}{\code{Numeric value} corresponding to the time horizon (number of years) for which the impacts of exposure are to be considered. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{dw_central, dw_lower, dw_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the disability weight associated with the morbidity health outcome of interest and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{duration_central, duration_lower, duration_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the duration associated with the morbidity health outcome of interest in years and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper bounds of the 95\% confidence interval. Default: 1. See Details section for more info.}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} specifying whether exposure is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant".}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Vector} referring to the total population, including both exposed and non-exposed (in each geographical unit). Only to be used to assess relative impact per 100k inhabitants.}

\item{info}{\code{String} or \code{data.frame} providing additional information to be linked with the assessment.
The suffix "info" will be added to the column name.
Default: \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }
}
\description{
This INTERNAL function calculates the health impacts, mortality or morbidity, of an environmental stressor using a single value for baseline heath data, i.e. without life table.
