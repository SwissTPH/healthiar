\arguments{
\item{approach_risk}{\code{String} specifying the risk risk method. Options: "relative_risk" (default) or "absolute_risk".}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the central estimate of the relative risk and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the increment of the exposure-response function in \eqn{µg/m^3} (usually 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}).}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions.
If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable: x (exposure), e.g. "3+x+x^2".
If a \code{function} is fed to the argument, it has be of the class function class, e.g. output from the functions \code{stats::splinefun()} or \code{stats::approxfun()}.
If you have x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) value pairs of multiple points lying on the the exposure-response function, you could use a cubic spline natural interpolation to derive the exposure-response function using, e.g. \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in \eqn{µg/m^3}. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the population exposed for each exposure category. For absolute risk, the value of this argument must be entered, for relative risk only optional.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to each exposure categories. Only to be used for exposure distribution (if pop_exp not available) or if not the whole population is exposed. Otherwise, 1 will be assumed as default.}

\item{cutoff_central, cutoff_lower, cutoff_upper}{\code{Numeric value} showing the central exposure cut-off in \eqn{µg/m^3} and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.
The cutoff level refers to the exposure level below which no health effects occur.
If exposure categories are used, the dimension of this input must be the same as in the \code{exp_...} argument(s). Default: 1 for a single exposure value.}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the basline (incidence) level of the health outcome in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{dw_central, dw_lower, dw_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the disability weight associated with the morbidity health outcome and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{duration_central, duration_lower, duration_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the disease duration in years and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper bounds of the 95\% confidence interval (default of \code{duratoin_central} is 1 year, which is aligned with the prevalence-based approach , while a value above 1 year corresponds to the incidence-based approach (Kim, 2022, https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.21.597).}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.
If a vector is entered here, the data for geo-specific input data (e.g. \code{bhd_...}), \code{exp_...}) has to be provided as a list.}

\item{geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} an ID for each geographic area that specifies which geographic areas should be aggregated together.
E.g. if you provide the municipality names to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}, you might provide here the corresponding region / canton / province.
Consequently The vector has to have the same length as the one fed to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}.}

\item{approach_multiexposure}{\code{String} specifying the approach that has to be used in assessments with multiple exposures. To choose among: "additive", "multiplicative" or "combined". Default: \code{NULL} (i.e. no other exposure is considered besides the one specified in the \code{exp.._ argument(s)})}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Vector} referring to the total population, including both exposed and non-exposed (in each geographical unit). Only to be used to assess relative impact per 100k inhabitants.}

\item{info}{\code{String} or {data.frame} providing additional information linked with the assessment.
The suffix "info" will be added to the column name.
Default value = \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
This function returns two lists: 1) \code{health_main}, which contains a tibble with the main results and
2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.
The result tibbles include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item pop_fraction (population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk)
 \item impact (health impact)
 \item And many more.
 }
}
\description{
This function first attributes disease cases of a specific morbidity health outcome to an environmental exposure.
Then this disease burden is then expressed in YLDs, using associated disability weight and duration.

For calculation of YLDs using life tables use \code{attribute_yld_from_lifetable}.

Assumption: cases happen at the start of the year.
