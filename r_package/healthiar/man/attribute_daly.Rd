\usage{
attribute_daly(output_attribute_yll, output_attribute_yld)
}
\value{
This function returns two lists: 1) \code{health_main}, which contains a tibble with the main results and
2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The main results tibble include columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item pop_fraction (population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk)
 \item impact (health impact, in this case YLL)
 \item impact_per_100k_inhab (impact per 100'000 inhabitants)
 \item And many more.
 }

The detailed results tibble additionally provides information on the year- and age-specific impacts for males and females seperately.
