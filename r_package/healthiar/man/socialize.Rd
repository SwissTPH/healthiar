}
\arguments{
\item{listed_output_attribute}{\code{List} containing \code{sub-lists} with the results of \code{healthiar::attribute_health()} for each age group. Each list element should refer to one specific age group.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the attributable health impacts by both age group and geo id.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric or string vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.}

\item{social_indicator}{\code{Numeric vector} showing the social indicator used for the analysis, e.g. a deprivation score (indicator of economic wealth) for each geographic unit. Based on this and \code{n_quantile}, \code{social_quantile} will be calculated.}

\item{increasing_deprivation}{\code{Boolean} variable (TRUE/FALSE) that specifies if deprivation is higher when the \code{social_indicator} is higher (TRUE) or lower (FALSE). Default value = TRUE.}

\item{n_quantile}{\code{Integer value} specifying to the number of quantiles in the analysis.}

\item{social_quantile}{\code{Numeric vector} showing the values from 1 to the number of quantiles assigned to each geographic unit. Either enter \code{social_indicator} and \code{n_quantile} or \code{social_quantile}}

\item{population}{\code{Integer vector} containing the population by age group and geographic unit.}

\item{age_group}{\code{String vector} with the age groups included in the age standardization. Each vector element refers to each of the list elements of \code{listed_output_attribute}.}

\item{ref_prop_pop}{\code{Numeric vector} with the reference proportion of population for each age group. If this argument is empty, the proportion of \code{population} by age group in the provided data will be used.}
}
\value{
Returns the impact (absolute and relative) theoretically attributable to the difference in the social indicator (e.g. degree of deprivation) between the quantiles.
}
\description{
This function considers socio-economic aspects (e.g. multiple deprivation index) in the attributable health impacts. If nothing is entered in the argument \code{listed_output_attribute}, it is assumed that all data come from a table and the argument refer to the columns of that table.
