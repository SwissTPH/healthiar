\title{Attribute discounted health impact}
\usage{
discount(
  output_healthiar = NULL,
  impact = NULL,
  discount_rate = NULL,
  discount_years = 1,
  discount_shape = NULL,
  inflation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_healthiar}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function). If a \code{Numberic vector} is entered multiple assessments (by year) will be carried out. Be aware that the value for year 0 (current) must be entered, while discount_years does not include the year 0. Thus, length of impact = discount_years + 1.}

\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years. If it is a nominal discount rate, no inflation is to be entered. If it is a real discount rate, the result can be adjusted by entering inflation in this function.}

\item{discount_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the period of time to be considered in the discounting. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, discount_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = discount_years + 1)}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{inflation}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Ony to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate)}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function i.e. central, lower and upper bound confidence interval.
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
It calculates discounted health impacts (without valuation).
