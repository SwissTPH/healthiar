\item{discount_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the period of time to be considered in the discounting.}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{discount_overtime}{\code{String} that refers to the year or years where the discounting has to be applied. Options: "all-years" (i.e. all years of the period of discounting; default option) or "last_year" (only last year of discounting). Only applicable if approach_discount = "direct".}
