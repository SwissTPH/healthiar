  inflation = inflation
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{\code{Data frame} including the column "impact" (health impact)}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact}

\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years including correction from inflation rate}

\item{discount_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the period of time to be considered in the discounting.}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. Per default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{discount_overtime}{\code{String} that refers to the year or years where the discounting has to be applied. Options: "all-years" (i.e. all years of the period of discounting; default option) or "last_year" (only last year of discounting). Only applicable if approach_discount = "direct".}

\item{inflation}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices) to be applied to the discount. Default value = NULL (asumming no inflaction or inflaction already applied in the provided discount rate)}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function).}
