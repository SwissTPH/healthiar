\arguments{
\item{output_healthiar}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results}

\item{impact}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the health impacts to be used for social analysis and matched with the argument \code{geo_id_disaggregated}.}

\item{population}{\code{Integer vector} containing the population per geographic unit and matched with the argument \code{geo_id_disaggregated}.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.
If a vector is entered here, the data for geo-specific input data (e.g. \code{bhd_...}), \exp{exp_...}) has to be provided as a list.}

\item{social_indicator}{\code{Vector} with numeric values showing the deprivation score (indicator of economic wealth) of the fine geographical area (it should match with those used in \code{attribute} or \code{compare})}

\item{n_quantile}{\code{Integer value} specifying to the number quantiles in the analysis}

\item{approach}{\code{String} referring the approach to include the social aspects. To choose between "quantile" and ?}
}
\value{
Returns the impact (absolute and relative) theoretically attributable to the difference in the social indicator (e.g. degree of deprivation) between the quantiles.
}
\description{
Consider socio-economic aspects in the results
