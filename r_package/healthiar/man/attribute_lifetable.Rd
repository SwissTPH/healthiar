\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only applicable in relative risk assessments
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }

\description{
This function assesses premature deaths or years of life lost (YLL) attributable to exposure to an environmental stressor using a life table approach.

\details{
\strong{Life table methodology}

The life table methodology of \code{attribute_lifetable()} follows that of the WHO tool AirQ+, and is described in more detail by Miller & Hurley (2003): https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.57.3.200.

A more expansive life table case study by Miller (2010) is available here: https://cleanair.london/app/uploads/CAL-098-Mayors-health-study-report-June-2010-1.pdf (accessed April 2025)

\strong{Conversion of alternative risk measures to relative risks}
For conversion of hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to relative risks refer to https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13197 and/or use the conversion tool for hazard ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/HR_RR.html; accessed April 2025) and/or odds ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/OR_RR.html; accessed April 2025).

\strong{Function arguments}

\code{population}

Mid-year population of year x can be approximated as the mean of either end-year populations of years x-1 and x or start-of-year populations of years x and x+1. In each age group population must be ≥ 1 to avoid problems in the calculation.

\code{approach_newborns}

If \code{"with_newborns"} is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies (population aged 0) are born.

\code{time_horizon}

For example, would be 10 if one is interested in the impacts of exposure during the year of analysis and the next 9 years (= 10 years in total).

\code{min_age}, \code{max_age}
The \code{min_age} default value 30 implies that all adults aged 30 or older will be affected by the exposure; \code{max_age} analogeously specifies the age above which no health effects of the exposure are considered.
