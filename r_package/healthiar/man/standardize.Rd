\title{Obtain age-standardized health impacts}
\usage{
standardize(output_attribute, age_group, ref_prop_pop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute}{\code{List} containing the outputs of the \code{healthiar::attribute_health()} assessments for each age group (each list element should be an age group-specific assessment).}

\item{age_group}{\code{String vector} with the age groups included in the age standardization. The vector refers to age-dependent data in this function and to \code{output_attribute} (if provided).}

\item{ref_prop_pop}{\code{Numeric vector} specifying with the reference proportion of population for each age group. If this argument is empty, the proportion of \code{population} by age group in the provided data will be used.}
}
\value{
Returns the impact (absolute and relative) theoretically attributable to the difference in the social indicator (e.g. degree of deprivation) between the quantiles.
}
