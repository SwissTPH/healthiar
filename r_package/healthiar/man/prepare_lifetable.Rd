\title{Determine deaths by one year age groups}
\usage{
prepare_lifetable(age_group, population, bhd, fraction_lived = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{age_group}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the first years of the age groups. E.g. c(0, 20, 40, 60) means [0, 20), [20, 40), [40, 60), [60, )}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to mid-year population by age group.}

\item{bhd}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the baseline health data (deaths) by age group.}

\item{fraction_lived}{\code{Numeric vector} or \code{value} (if all values the same in the vector) referring to the fraction of last year lived.}
}
\value{
Returns deaths by one year age groups.
}
\description{
This function determines deaths by one year age groups
}
\details{
See the AirQ+ manual "Health impact assessment of air pollution: AirQ+ life table manual" for guidance on how to convert larger age groups to 1 year age groups (section "Estimation of yearly values"): https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337683/WHO-EURO-2020-1559-41310-56212-eng.pdf (accessed April 2025)
