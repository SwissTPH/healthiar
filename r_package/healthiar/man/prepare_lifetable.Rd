\title{Deaths by single age}
\usage{
prepare_lifetable(age_group, population, bhd, fraction_lived = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{age_group}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the first year of n-years interval of the age groups. E.g. c(0, 20, 40, 60) means [0, 20), [20, 40), [40, 60), [60, )}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to mid-year population by age group.}

\item{bhd}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the baseline health data (deaths) by age group.}

\item{fraction_lived}{\code{Numeric vector} or \code{value} (if all values the same in the vector) referring to the fraction of last year lived.}
}
\value{
Baseline health data (deaths) by 1-year interval instead of interval.
}
\description{
This function performs a cost-benefit analysis
}
\examples{
# Goal: Convert 5-year population and death data into 1-year data
