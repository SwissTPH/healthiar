\arguments{
\item{output_attribute_1}{\code{List} containing the output of the function attribute() for scenario 1.}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String value} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options (no default): \code{"linear"}, \code{log_linear}", \code{"linear_log"}, \code{"log_log"}. Argument is applicable only in RR pathway.}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the central estimate of the relative risk and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds. Argument is applicable only in RR pathway.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the concentration increment for which the provided relative risk is valid. Often 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}) (no default). Argument is applicable only in RR pathway.}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions. See Details for more info.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. See Details for more info.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to the exposure (categories). Default: 1. See Details for more info.}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the population exposed for each exposure category. For absolute risk, the value of this argument must be entered, for relative risk it is optional.}

\item{cutoff_central, cutoff_lower, cutoff_upper}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the exposure cut-off in \eqn{µg/m^3} and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds. Default: 0. Only applicable in relative risk pathway. See Details for more info.}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} providing the baseline health data of the health outcome of interest in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds. Argument is only applicable in RR pathway. See Details for more info.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated, geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} or \code{string vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area considered in the assessment (\code{geo_id_disaggregated}) and (optionally) providing a higher-level ID at which the geographic areas will be aggregated (\code{geo_id_disaggregated}). Argument must be entered for iterations. See Details for more info.}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{numeric vector} specifying the total population, including both exposed and non-exposed. See Details for more info.}

\item{info}{\code{String} or \code{data frame} specifying information to be linked with the assessment. Optional argument. See Details for more info.}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{population_midyear_female, population_midyear_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year populations per age (age interval = 1 year) for the year of analysis for females and males, respectively. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{deaths_female, deaths_male}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the deaths for the year of analysis per age (age interval = 1 year) for females and males, respectively. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{min_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the minimum age for which the exposure will affect the exposed population. Default: 30. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{max_age}{\code{Numberic value} specifying the maximum age until which age the population will be affected by the environmental exposure. No default. See the Details section for more info.}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} specifying whether exposure is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant".}

\item{approach_newborns}{\code{String} specifying whether newborns are to be considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns". If "with_newborns" is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies are born, with n being equal to the (male and female) population aged 0 that is provided in the arguments \code{population_midyear_male} and \code{population_midyear_female}.}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} providing the year of analysis.}

\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }
}
\description{
This function assesses the attributable health impacts in a new scenario 2 which is obtained by modifying an existing scenario 1. Supply an existing attribute output and specify how scenario 1 should be modified to create scenario 2.
