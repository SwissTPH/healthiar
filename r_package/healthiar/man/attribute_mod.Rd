\arguments{
\item{output_attribute_1}{\code{List} containing the output of the function attribute() for scenario 1.}

\item{exp_central, exp_lower, exp_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the exposure level(s) to the environmental stressor and (optionally) to lower and upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. If only one value is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to population-weighted mean exposure in \eqn{µg/m^3}. If a {vector} is provided, it will be assumed that it refers to the exposure categories (average exposure in the category) in a exposure distribution (this information is linked to the proportion of population exposed).}

\item{bhd_central, bhd_lower, bhd_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} providing the basline (incidence) level of the health outcome in the study population and (optionally) the corresponding lower bound and the upper 5\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{rr_central, rr_lower, rr_upper}{\code{Numeric value(s)} specifying the central estimate of the relative risk and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval bounds.}

\item{rr_increment}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the concentration increment for which the provided relative risk is valid. Often 10 or 5 \eqn{µg/m^3}).}

\item{erf_shape}{\code{String} specifying the shape of the exposure-response function to be assumed. Options: "linear", log_linear", "linear_log", "log_log".}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{\code{String} or \code{function} specifying the equation of the user-defined exposure-response function and (optionally) the corresponding lower and upper 95\% confidence interval functions.
If a \code{string} is entered, the function must contains only one variable: x (exposure), e.g. "3+x+x^2".
If a \code{function} is fed to the argument, it has be of the class function class, e.g. output from the functions \code{stats::splinefun()} or \code{stats::approxfun()}.
If you have x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) value pairs of multiple points lying on the the exposure-response function, you could use a cubic spline natural interpolation to derive the exposure-response function using, e.g. \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}.}

\item{population}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Vector} referring to the total population, including both exposed and non-exposed (in each geographical unit). Only to be used to assess relative impact per 100k inhabitants.}

\item{prop_pop_exp}{\code{Numeric value} or \code{Numeric vector} specifying the fraction(s) (value from 0 until and including 1) of the total population exposed to each exposure categories. Only to be used for exposure distribution (if pop_exp not available) or if not the whole population is exposed. Otherwise, 1 will be assumed as default.}

\item{pop_exp}{\code{Numeric vector} referring to the population exposed for each exposure category. For absolute risk, the value of this argument must be entered, for relative risk only optional.}

\item{approach_exposure}{\code{String} specifying whether exposure is constant or only in one year. Options: "single_year" (default), "constant".}

\item{approach_newborns}{\code{String} specifying whether newborns are to be considered in the years after the year of analysis. Options: "without_newborns" (default), "with_newborns". If "with_newborns" is selected, it is assumed that for each year after the year of analysis n babies are born, with n being equal to the (male and female) population aged 0 that is provided in the arguments \code{population_midyear_male} and \code{population_midyear_female}.}

\item{first_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the youngest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{last_age_pop}{\code{Numeric value} specifying the age of the oldest age group from population and life table data (age interval = 1 year).}

\item{population_midyear_male, population_midyear_female}{\code{Numeric vector} containing the mid-year population for the year of analysis for female and male, respectively.}

\item{year_of_analysis}{\code{Numeric value} providing the year of analysis.}

\item{geo_id_disaggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} providing the unique ID codes of each geographic area (e.g. municipalities) considered in the assessment.
If a vector is entered here, the data for geo-specific input data (e.g. \code{bhd_...}), \code{exp_...}) has to be provided as a list.}

\item{geo_id_aggregated}{\code{Numeric vector} an ID for each geographic area that specifies which geographic areas should be aggregated together.
E.g. if you provide the municipality names to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}, you might provide here the corresponding region / canton / province.
Consequently The vector has to have the same length as the one fed to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}.}

\item{info}{\code{String} or {data.frame} providing additional information linked with the assessment.
The suffix "info" will be added to the column name.
Default value = \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{list} with the attributable
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
The function assesses the attributable health impacts in a new scenario (2) by modifying an existing scenario (1). The values of the arguments of this function (except output_attribute_1) are used to replace the values in the arguments of scenario 1 to build scenario 2.
