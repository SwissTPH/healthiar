\arguments{
\item{approach_comparison}{\code{String} showing the method of comparison. Options: "delta" or "pif".}

\item{exp_central_1}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution in the scenario 1.}

\item{exp_central_2}{\code{Numeric value} showing the population-weighted mean exposure in ug/m3 or {vector} showing the exposure category in a exposure distribution in the scenario 2.}

\item{erf_eq_central, erf_eq_lower, erf_eq_upper}{Equation of the user-defined exposure-response function that puts the relative risk (y) in relation with exposure (x). If the function is provided as \code{string}, it can only contains one variable: x (exposure). E.g. "3+x+x^2". If the function is provided as a \code{function}, the object should have a function class. If only the values of the x-axis (exposure) and y axis (relative risk) of the dots in the exposure-response function are available, a cubic spline natural interpolation can be assumed to get the function using, e.g., \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}}

\item{geo_id_raw}{\code{Vector} showing the id code of the each geographic area considered in the assessment. If a vector is entered here, the data for each geographical area have to be provided as list in the corresponding arguments.}

\item{info_1}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id of the scenario 1. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}

\item{info_2}{\code{String} or {data frame} showing additional information or id of the scenario 1. The suffix "info" will be added to the column name. Default value = NULL.}
}
\value{
TBD. E.g. This function returns a \code{data.frame} with one row for each value of the
concentration-response function (i.e. central estimate, lower and upper bound confidence interval).
Moreover, the data frame includes columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item Attributable fraction
 \item Health impact
 \item Outcome metric
 \item And many more.
}
}
\description{
Calculates the health impacts between two scenarios (e.g. before and after a intervention in a health impact assessments). It provides as a result the central estimate as well as the lower and the higher bound of the confidence interval based on the uncertainty of the exposure-response function.
