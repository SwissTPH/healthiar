)
}
\arguments{
\item{approach_comparison}{\code{String} showing the method of comparison. Options: "delta" or "pif".}

\description{
Calculates the health impacts between two scenarios (e.g. before and after a intervention in a health impact assessments) using either the delta or pif approach.
}
\details{
Note that several input parameters (such as baseline health data and relative risk must be the same to correctly compare the two scenarios.
