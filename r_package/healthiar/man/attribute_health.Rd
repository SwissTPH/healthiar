\value{
This function returns two \code{lists}:

1) \code{health_main}, which contains a \code{tibble} with the main results and

2) \code{health_detailed}, which contains detailed (and interim) results.

The results contain columns such as:
\itemize{
 \item \code{pop_fraction} population attributable fraction; only for assessments using relative risk
 \item \code{impact} attributable health burden/impact
 \item And many more
 }
}
\description{
This function calculates the health impacts (mortality or morbidity)
of exposure to an environmental stressor (air pollution or noise), using either relative risk (RR) or absolute risk (AR).

For examples please see the vignette and/or below.

Generally, the health metric you put in (e.g. absolute disease cases, deaths per 100'000 population, DALYs, prevalence, incidence, ...) is the one you get out. Exception: if you enter a disability weight the main output will be years lived with disability.
}
\details{
\strong{Iteration}

To iterate an assessment across multiple geographic units with \code{attribute_health()}, you must enter vectors of unit-specific

- unique geo IDs to \code{geo_id_disaggregated} (\emph{both RR and AR pathways}), and optionally \code{geo_id_aggregated} (\emph{both RR and AR pathways});

- exposure values to \code{exp_...} (\emph{both RR and AR pathways});

- baseline health data values to \code{bhd_...} (\emph{RR pathway only})

- (in case of multiple exposure categories) values specifying the population exposed per exposure category to \code{pop_exp} (\emph{both RR and AR pathways})

- (in case of mutliple exposure categories) values specifying the proportion of the total exposed population that is exposed to each exposure category to \code{prop_pop_exp} (\emph{both RR and AR pathways; in AR pathway in combination with \code{pop_exp}})

- population values specifying total population (exposed + non-exposed)

The length of each of these vectors listed above must be: length = (number of geo units) x (number of exposure categories).

To the other function arguments not listed above you can feed either a vector of the same length or a single value (will be recycled).

\strong{Function arguments}

\code{erf_eq_central}, \code{erf_eq_lower}, \code{erf_eq_upper}

If a value is entered here do not enter any values to \code{rr_central}, \code{rr_lower}, \code{rr_upper}, \code{rr_increment}, \code{erf_shape} arguments.
Enter the exposure-response function as a \code{string} formula containing only one variable \emph{c} representing concentration/exposure, e.g. \code{"3+c+c^2"},  or as a \code{function}, e.g. output from \code{stats::splinefun()} or \code{stats::approxfun()}.

If you have x-axis (exposure) and y-axis (relative risk) value pairs of multiple points lying on the the exposure-response function, you could use a cubic spline natural interpolation to derive the exposure-response function using, e.g. \code{stats::splinefun(x, y, method="natural")}.

\code{exp_central}, \code{exp_lower}, \code{exp_upper}

In case of exposure bands enter the one exposure value per band (e.g. the mean of the lower and upper bounds).

\code{prop_pop_exp}

Indicates the share of the population exposed to each exposure category. In the AR pathway must be used in combination with \code{pop_exp}.

\code{cutoff_central}, \code{cutoff_lower}, \code{cutoff_upper}

The cutoff level refers to the exposure level below which no health effects occur. If exposure categories are used, the length of this input must be the same as in the \code{exp_...} argument(s).

\code{bhd_central}, \code{bhd_lower}, \code{bhd_upper}

Baseline health data for each exposure category must be entered.

\code{geo_id_aggregated}, \code{geo_id_disaggregated}

For example, if you provide the municipality names to \code{geo_id_disaggregated}, you might provide to \code{geo_id_aggregated} the corresponding region / canton / province.
Consequently, the vectors fed to \code{geo_id_disaggregated} and \code{geo_id_aggregated} must be of the same length.

\code{population}

Used to assess impact rate per 100'000 inhabitants.

\code{duration_central}, \code{duration_lower}, \code{duration_upper}

The default of \code{duratoin_central} is 1 year, which is aligned with the prevalence-based approach , while a value above 1 year corresponds to the incidence-based approach (Kim, 2022, https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.21.597).

\code{info}

Information entered to this argument will be added as column(s) (with the suffix \code{_info}) to the results table.

\strong{Equations (relative risk)}

The most general equation describing the population attributable fraction (PAF) mathematically is an integral form
\deqn{PAF = \frac{\int RR(x)PE(x)dx - 1}{\int RR(x)PE(x)dx}}

Where:

x     = exposure level

PE(x) = population distribution of exposure

RR(x) = relative risk at exposure level compared to the reference level

If the population exposure is described as a categorical rather than continuous exposure, the integrals in this equation may be converted to sums, resulting in the following equation for the PAF
\deqn{PAF = \frac{\sum RR_i \times PE_i dx - 1}{\sum RR_i \times PE_i dx}}

Where:

i     = is the exposure category (e.g. in bins of 1 \eqn{µg/m^3} PM2.5 or 5 dB noise exposure)

\eqn{PE_i} = fraction of population in exposure category i

\eqn{RR_i} = relative risk for exposure category level i compared to the reference level

There is one alternative for the PAF for categorical exposure distribution that is commonly used. It is mathematically equivalent to the equation right above, meaning that numerical estimates based on these equations are identical.
\deqn{PAF = \frac{\sum PE_i(RR_i - 1)}{\sum PE_i(RR_i - 1) + 1}}

Where:

i     = is the exposure category (e.g. in bins of 1 \eqn{µg/m^3} PM2.5 or 5 dB noise exposure)

\eqn{PE_i} = fraction of population in exposure category i

\eqn{RR_i} = relative risk for exposure category level i compared to the reference level

Finally, if the exposure is provided as the population weighted mean concentration (PWC), the equation for the PAF is reduced to
\deqn{PAF = \frac{RR_{PWC} - 1}{RR_{PWC}}}
Where \eqn{RR_PWC} is the relative risk associated with the population weighted mean exposure.

\strong{Equation (absolute risk)}
\deqn{N = \sum AR_i\times PE_i}

Where:

N = the number of cases of the exposure-specific health outcome that are attributed to the exposure

\eqn{AR_i} = absolute risk at the mean of exposure bin i

\eqn{PE_i} = fraction of the population exposed to exposure levels of the exposure category i

\strong{Conversion of alternative risk measures to relative risks}
For conversion of hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to relative risks refer to https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13197 and/or use the conversion tool for hazard ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/HR_RR.html) and/or odds ratios (https://ebm-helper.cn/en/Conv/OR_RR.html).
