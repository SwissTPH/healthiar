\usage{
cba(
  output_attribute = NULL,
  positive_impact = NULL,
  valuation,
  cost,
  discount_rate_benefit = NULL,
  discount_rate_cost = NULL,
  discount_shape = "exponential",
  discount_years_benefit = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact}

\item{cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the investment cost to achieve the reduction of exposure}

\item{discount_rate_benefit, discount_rate_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the the discount rate used in the benefit and the cost side (respectively). Their values determine the approach of cost-benefit analysis: direct approach (if the same discount_rate is used for cost and benefit) and indirect approach (different discount rates)}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{benefit}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the positive health impact as result of a reduction of harmful exposure}
