cba(
  output_attribute = NULL,
  impact_benefit = NULL,
  valuation,
  cost,
  discount_rate_benefit = NULL,
  discount_rate_cost = NULL,
  inflation_rate = NULL,
  discount_shape = "exponential",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{output_attribute}{\code{List} produced by \code{healthiar::attribute()} or \code{healthiar::compare()} as results.}

\item{impact_benefit}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the positive health impact as result of a reduction of harmful exposure.}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact.}

\item{cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the investment cost to achieve the reduction of exposure.}

\item{discount_rate_benefit, discount_rate_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to the the discount rate used in the benefit and the cost side (respectively). Their values determine the approach of cost-benefit analysis: direct approach (if the same discount_rate is used for cost and benefit) and indirect approach (different discount rates).}

\item{inflation_rate}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate).}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{n_years_benefit, n_years_cost}{\code{Numeric value} referring to number of years in the future to be considered in the benefit and cost side (respectively). Years for discounting and/or inflation. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting/inflation, i.e. the present) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, n_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = n_years + 1)}

Description of the return value.

\description{
This function performs a cost-benefit analysis

\details{
\strong{Equation cost-benefit analysis}

\deqn{net\_benefit = benefit - cost}

\deqn{cost\_benefit\_ratio = \frac{benefit}{cost}}

\deqn{return\_on\_investment = \frac{benefit - cost}{cost } \times 100}

For the equations regarding the monetization of the cost and the benefit please see the function documentation of \code{monetize()}.
