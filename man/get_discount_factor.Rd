\usage{
get_discount_factor(
  discount_rate,
  discount_year,
  discount_shape = "exponential",
  inflation = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years. If it is a nominal discount rate, no inflation is to be entered. If it is a real discount rate, the result can be adjusted by entering inflation in this function.}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{inflation}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate)}
}
\description{
This function calculates the discount factor based on discount rate. If the argument \code{inflation} is NULL (default), it is assumed that the discount rate is already corrected for inflation). Otherwise (if a value for \code{inflation} is entered), the resulted discount factor is adjusted for inflation.
