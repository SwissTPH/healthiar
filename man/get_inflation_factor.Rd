\title{Get inflation factor}
\usage{
get_inflation_factor(n_years, inflation_rate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to number of years in the future to be considered in the discounting and/or inflation. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting/inflation, i.e. the present) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, n_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = n_years + 1)}

\item{inflation_rate}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate)}
}
\description{
This function calculates the inflation factor based on inflation rate.
