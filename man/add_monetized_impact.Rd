\usage{
add_monetized_impact(
  df,
  valuation,
  discount_rate,
  n_years,
  discount_shape,
  inflation,
  info = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{\code{Data frame} including the column "impact" (health impact)}

\item{valuation}{\code{Numberic value} referring to unit value of a health impact.}

\item{discount_rate}{\code{Numeric value} showing the discount rate for future years. If it is a nominal discount rate, no inflation is to be entered. If it is a real discount rate, the result can be adjusted by entering inflation in this function.}

\item{n_years}{\code{Numeric value} referring to number of years in the future to be considered in the discounting and/or inflation. Be aware that the year 0 (without discounting/inflation, i.e. the present) is not be counted here. If a vector is entered in the argument impact, n_years does not need to be entered (length of impact = n_years + 1)}

\item{discount_shape}{\code{String} referring to the assumed equation for the discount factor. By default: "exponential". Otherwise: "hyperbolic_harvey_1986" or "hyperbolic_mazur_1987".}

\item{inflation}{\code{Numeric value} between 0 and 1 referring to the annual inflation (increase of prices). Only to be entered if nominal (not real) discount rate is entered in the function. Default value = NULL (assuming no nominal discount rate)}

\item{info}{\code{String}, \code{data frame} or \code{tibble} providing \strong{information about the assessment}. Only attached if \code{impact} is entered by the users. If \code{output_attribute} is entered, use \code{info} in that function or add the column manually. \emph{Optional argument.}}

\item{impact}{\code{Numberic value} referring to the health impacts to be monetized (without attribute function).}
